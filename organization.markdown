### Seminar organization
* I am organizing a learning seminar with Andrew Comech.  It meets Fridays 3-4 in Blocker 624.
* I am also an occasional orgznizer and regular participant in the Mathematical Physics, Harmonic Analysis, and Differential Equations seminar.  [Link to schedule](https://www.math.tamu.edu/seminars/harmonic)

    
### Conference Organization
I was an organizer of the following conferences/workshops:  
* [Texas Analysis and Mathematical Physics Symposium (TexAMP)](https://texamp.github.io) (with Gregory Berkolaiko, Andrew Comech, Peter Kuchment, Wencai Liu, Jonas L&uuml;hmann, and Minh-Binh Tran), held in February 2024 at Texas A&amp;M University.
* [FullingFest: A celebration of the work of Stephan A. Fulling](https://sites.google.com/tamu.edu/fullingfest) (with Gregory Berkolaiko and Marlan Scully), held in October 2022 at Texas A&amp;M University.
* The 56th and 62nd meetings (with J.M. Landsberg and Igor Zelenko) and the 68th meeting (with Zhizhang Xie and Igor Zelenko) of the [Texas Geometry and Topology Conference](https://www.math.tamu.edu/~tgtc/archive/), held in 2016, 2019, and 2024 at Texas A&M University.
* The [Third Symposium on Scattering and Spectral Theory](https://www.math.purdue.edu/~sabarre/SymposiumFlorianopolis.html) (with Raphael Hora, Gerardo Mendoza, Wagner Muniz, and Ant&ocirc;nio S&aacute; Barreto), held July 17 to 28, 2017 in Florian&oacute;polis, Brazil.
* A CIRM workshop on Evolution Equations on Singular Spaces (with Luc Hillairet and Jared Wunsch) held in Luminy, France in 2016.
* The 73rd Midwest PDE Seminar (with Valentino Tosatti, Ben Weinkove, Jared Wunsch, and Steve Zelditch), held at Northwestern University in 2014.
* A workshop on evolution equations in honor of Terence Tao (with Igor Rodnianski, Gigliola Staffilani, and Jared Wunsch), held at Northwestern University in 2012.
* A workshop on microlocal methods in spectral and scattering theory (with Emmanuel Schenck, Andr&aacute;s Vasy, Jared Wunsch, and Steve Zelditch), held at Northwestern University in 2011.
