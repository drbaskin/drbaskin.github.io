I am an associate professor in the math department at Texas A&amp;M
University.  Before arriving here I was a Boas Assistant Professor at
Northwestern University.  I received my Ph.D from Stanford University
in 2010.  I was a student of Rafe Mazzeo and Andr&aacute;s Vasy.  

My (likely out-of-date) CV is available here: [CV]({{ site.url }}/assets/pdf/cv.pdf)

I can be reached at dbaskin 'at' math.tamu.edu.  If you are inquiring
about a course I am teaching, please contact mem instead at dbaskin
'at' tamu.edu.

My research is in partial differential equations generally and in
geometric microlocal analysis more specifically.  I am particularly
interested in the study of wave-like equations on singular
backgrounds.

If you are a student interested in working with me, you should take
the real analysis qualifying exam (the complex analysis qualifying
exam is OK, too, but the real analysis exam is preferable).  For the
other qualifier, you should likely take the geometry/topology exam, as
much of the analysis I do takes place on manifolds.
