In Fall 2025, I will teach MATH 460 (Tensors and general relativity) and MATH 663 (Topics in semiclassical analysis).

I am currently also coordinating a graduate student writing group.  It meets Tuesdays 9-11 in Blocker 624.

In the past I have taught the following courses at Texas A&amp;M:  
* Math 151H (Engineering Calculus I, Honors, Fall 2018)</li>
* Math 171 (Calculus I, Spring 2020, Fall 2021)</li>
* Math 221 (Calculus III, Fall 2014)</li>
* Math 304 (Linear Algebra, Spring 2015)</li>
* Math 308 (Differential Equations, Fall 2015, Spring 2024, Fall 2025)</li>
* Math 323 (Linear Algebra, Fall 2017)</li>
* Math 460 (General Relativity, Fall 2015, Fall 2021, Fall 2023)</li>
* Math 470 (Communications and Cryptography, Fall 2022)</li>
* Math 608 (Real Analysis II, Spring 2025)
* Math 622 (Differential Geometry I, Spring 2017, Spring 2023)</li>
* Math 623 (Differential Geometry II, Fall 2017, Fall 2023)</li>
* Math 689 (A graduate topics course on microlocal analysis, Fall 2015)</li>
