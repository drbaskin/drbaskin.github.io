I am currently teaching Math 460 (Tensors and General Relativity) and Math 623 (Differential Geometry II).

Here are the (incomplete) [lecture notes]({{ site.url }}/assets/pdf/dg2notes.pdf) that I am using for Math 623 in Fall 2023.  Please e-mail me if you want the (also still very rough) notes for Math 622.

I am continuing to organize the graduate student writing groups;
please contact me if you would like to join them.

In the past I have taught the following courses at Texas A&amp;M:
<ul class="paragraph-text">
  <li>Math 151H (Engineering Calculus I, Honors, Fall 2018)</li>
  <li>Math 171 (Calculus I, Spring 2020, Fall 2021)</li>
  <li>Math 221 (Calculus III, Fall 2014)</li>
  <li>Math 304 (Linear Algebra, Spring 2015)</li>
  <li>Math 308 (Differential Equations, Fall 2015)</li>
  <li>Math 323 (Linear Algebra, Fall 2017)</li>
  <li>Math 460 (General Relativity, Fall 2015, Fall 2021, Fall 2023)</li>
  <li>Math 470 (Communications and Cryptography, Fall 2022)</li>
  <li>Math 622 (Differential Geometry I, Spring 2017, Spring 2023)</li>
  <li>Math 623 (Differential Geometry II, Fall 2017)</li>
  <li>Math 689 (A graduate topics course on microlocal analysis, Fall 2015)</li>
</ul>
