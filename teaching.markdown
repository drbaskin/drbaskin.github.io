I am currently teaching two honors sections of differential equations (MATH 308).  

I am not currently organizing the graduate student writing group because the graduate students have organized themselves.  Please let me know if you have questions about graduate student writing groups.

In the past I have taught the following courses at Texas A&amp;M:
<ul class="paragraph-text">
  <li>Math 151H (Engineering Calculus I, Honors, Fall 2018)</li>
  <li>Math 171 (Calculus I, Spring 2020, Fall 2021)</li>
  <li>Math 221 (Calculus III, Fall 2014)</li>
  <li>Math 304 (Linear Algebra, Spring 2015)</li>
  <li>Math 308 (Differential Equations, Fall 2015, Spring 2024, Fall 2025)</li>
  <li>Math 323 (Linear Algebra, Fall 2017)</li>
  <li>Math 460 (General Relativity, Fall 2015, Fall 2021, Fall 2023)</li>
  <li>Math 470 (Communications and Cryptography, Fall 2022)</li>
  <li>Math 622 (Differential Geometry I, Spring 2017, Spring 2023)</li>
  <li>Math 623 (Differential Geometry II, Fall 2017, Fall 2023)</li>
  <li>Math 689 (A graduate topics course on microlocal analysis, Fall 2015)</li>
</ul>
